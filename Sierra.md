Sierra is a popular ILS.

There are currently two active versions of the Sierra API: [Version
2](https://sandbox.iii.com/docs/v2/Content/zTutorials/tutAuthenticate.htm)
and [Version
3](https://sandbox.iii.com/docs/Content/zTutorials/tutAuthenticate.htm).

We currently believe that version 2 cannot be integrated with Library Simplified. Libraries that use version 2 of Sierra API should either upgrade to version 3 or install another API such as [Millenium].
