# Registration Workflow
Users can browse the app without registering, but upon checking out or putting it on hold, they will need to sign up to a NYPL.org account AND have a temporary borrowing barcode.


## Temporary Barcode
* Temporary Barcode will need to allow borrowing. Temporary barcode will need to set up a PIN.

# Browse systems
* way to ignore books should be there
 * For any book shown to me (in the browse lanes), there should be a way to have it be removed and express if it is being removed because you read it or just don't want to see something like it

## Language
Changing "Hold Queue" to "In Line" with a time estimate.

But we need a better term for talking about it.

RESERVE!!!

# Questions
* Is access to the patron's barcode + pin available to our app via the API patron?
 * If so - they don't have to type in a pin
 * Creates use cases where I have a barcode and account, but not a pin
* Hold language
