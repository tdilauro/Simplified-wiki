# Registration Workflow
Users can browse the app without registering, but upon checking out or putting it on hold, they will need to sign up to a NYPL.org account AND have a temporary borrowing barcode.


## Temporary Barcode
* Temporary Barcode will need to allow borrowing. Temporary barcode will need to set up a PIN.


# Questions
* Is access to the patron's barcode + pin available to our app via the API patron?
 * If so - they don't have to type in a pin
 * Creates use cases where I have a barcode and account, but not a pin
* Hold language
