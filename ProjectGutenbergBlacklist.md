Project Gutenberg books we don't want to include in our catalog for various reasons.

* Any book whose RDF description does not include a dcterms:rights of "Public domain in the USA." (Exceptions, e.g. the works of Cory Doctorow, will be whitelisted on an individual basis--and we can probably get better-formatted copies of these works elsewhere.)

* Any books whose title includes "Works Of", except possibly #100 "Complete Works of William Shakespeare". These are compilation works and the individual titles are available individually. Alternatively: blacklist only the "on-line index" books (most of them) and leave the actual compilations alone.

* Any books whose title includes "Project Gutenberg"?
