Library Simplified is a collection of middleware, server software and mobile client applications for iOS and Android.

The pages below document various best practices and workflows important for anyone contributing to the mobile client applications. What's considered a best practice will no doubt evolve over time, as should this document.

But first, a bit of wisdom.

> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.
>
> However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask! &mdash; [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds)
