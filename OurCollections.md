# Language makeup

Only one language is counted per book, so the 'total' is the total number of books in that collection.

For reference, here are the main language communities we need to serve, according to James:

* en (English)
* es (Spanish)
* zh (Chinese)
* fr (French)
* de (German)
* pl (Polish)
* ru (Russian)
* ko (Korean)
* iw (Hebrew)
* hi (Hindi)

# Subject

I include every classification that shows up more than 100 times. Every one of a book's classifications is counted, so the number of classifications is much higher than the number of books.

## 3M

3M provides no subject information; we need to get it from OCLC.
