# Language makeup

Only one language is counted per book, so the 'total' is the total number of books in that collection.

For reference, here are the main language communities we need to serve, according to James:

* en (English)
* es (Spanish)
* zh (Chinese)
* fr (French)
* de (German)
* pl (Polish)
* ru (Russian)
* ko (Korean)
* iw (Hebrew)
* hi (Hindi)

## 3M

* "en" 14496
* "es" 46
* _Total: 14542_

## Overdrive

* "ja" 21
* "it" 19

* _Total: 44921_
* Languages with less than 100 titles each: 1561
* _Grand total_: 45482

# Subject

I include every classification that is used for at least 0.5% of the books. Every one of a book's classifications is counted, so the number of classifications is much higher than the number of books.

## 3M

3M provides no subject information; we need to get it from OCLC.
