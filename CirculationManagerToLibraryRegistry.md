Here's the work we have to do to automatically integrate the circulation manager with the library registry:

# After popularity hits

We don't really need this stuff until we start getting a large number
of libraries in the system that don't fit the "geographically localized public library" mold.

## Circulation manager

- [Service area editor](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/578)
- [Select audiences for library](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/581)

## Library registry

- Improve presentation of libraries through lenses other than geography

# Already done

## Circulation manager

- [Logo uploader](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/566)
- [Store library registry URL](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/576)
- [Manual "Update registration" button](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/577) that kicks off registration procedure
- [Autogenerate public key](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/579)
- [Manual "set shared secret" button](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/580) that negotiates shared secret with library registry.
- [Insert estimated collection sizes into authentication document](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/issues/583)

## Library registry

- [Implement library sync.](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/library_registry/issues/24)
- [Incorporate shared secret into library sync.](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/library_registry/issues/24)
