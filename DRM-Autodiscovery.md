The Library Simplified circulation manager and its mobile clients are designed to negotiate access to content encrypted by various DRM schemes, without requiring any special action on the part of a patron who just wants to read a book.

DRM systems are generally designed for the use case of a book distributor (e.g. a bookstore) providing a white-label app to its customers. This assumption does not hold for Library Simplified. Our mobile client can access multiple libraries, each of which might grant access to books hosted by multiple distributors. DRM specs leave certain parts of the control flow undefined, especially as regards the initial setup of a patron's account.

This page tracks the additional conventions we've come up with to fill in those gaps.
