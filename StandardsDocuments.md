# Document formats

## OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System)

OPDS is an XML document format based on Atom. We use it to talk about library books and give instructions for borrowing them. OPDS is at the core of our strategy: we use it to communicate with patrons as well as for machine-to-machine integrations.

## ODL (Open Distribution to Libraries)

ODL is a JSON document format used by ebook distributors to send licensing information to libraries.
