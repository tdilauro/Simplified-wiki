# Document formats

## OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System)

OPDS is an XML document format based on Atom. We use it to talk about library books and give instructions for borrowing them. OPDS is at the core of our strategy: we use it to communicate with patrons as well as for machine-to-machine integrations.

## Authentication for OPDS

Authentication for OPDS is a JSON document format used by libraries and bookstores to guide users through the authentication process, and add light branding to a generic OPDS reader.
