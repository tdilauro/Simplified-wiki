# Things that'll sync
* Books in your library [which books, but not the epub itself]
 * If the book is in Gutenberg, we can sync it
 *If the book is in overdrive, we need to go through the API for the download link
  * Can a secondary device get the media file?

# Everything except for epubs
* There are situations where you don't want syncing (family with different devices, but one card)
* Each device syncing to server sends a "Device ID" (random ID)
* May be possible to delegate a device to only have access to NYPL Kids


# Epubs
* If syncing is possible, it should be the default
