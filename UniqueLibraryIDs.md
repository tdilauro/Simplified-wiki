Until the Library Simpified library registry is up and running, libraries are given unique IDs that are stored in simplified-app-simplye/src/main/assets/Accounts.json and hard-coded in the client apps.

This wiki page keeps track of the unique IDs that have been assigned to participating libraries. These libraries might not have any code in the client apps, because they're not ready to launch yet, but their numbers are reserved and should not be reused.
