# Crit of Joe's wireframed mockups [4/22/14] (TODO: link to the images)

Screens:
1. Sign in
2. Home screen (browse)
3. Profile


## Core Feedback
* Background blur
 * Jen has vetoed because design committee (she + COMM wouldn't approve)
 * "It's just not on brand"
 * "I don't have anything I can give you for mobile now."
* Circular profile photos
 * If we're using them, we should use them everywhere
* Colors
 * Eliminate red
  * Was in the original but Jen is using it only for donate and massive callouts

Differing aesthetic is warming on Jen because of the sharability of it and need for customizability form partner libraries.

* "First thing is contrast. As long as what's happening in the backgournd is not contrasted"
* Topscreen icons should be same size as NYPL Logo in menu on main screen
* 


* Profile page: 3 major sections don't exactly match
 * Each of the sections is visually different; inconsistent styles

* Jen's cool with the design direction now that it's generalizable

* Do we have a concept of a username for NYPL sign-in?
* Where are the books I've checked out?
 * Homescreen - would be another vertial row for Just Checked Out
* Show expected arrival time
* Should make a very clear statement when you've got to take action to check out an item
* Use case that's not being addressed here is looking for a book that you recognize
 * no solution for that in a library
 * Leonard: "There is a use case between browsing and searching"
  * i.e. alphabetized
* Not in mockups: Browse by Genre - wide-ranging genres
* Possible to increase size of lane while scrolling?
 * Could reduce the opacity while scrolling to increase emphasis
* Balance between text (i.e title/author) and cover art
 * Cover art useful as an anchor because you remembered it 


* profile
 * What's the point? Can we eliminate this page?
 * Does e-newsletter make sense here? Does events make sense here?
 * Detracts from core functionality
 * Eliminating this lets us restyle the profile page so it can have the stream of on hold as opposed to swimlane



* What does tapping the lion do? : nothing

* Could there be a visual way to indicate status of if it's available or not? 
 * could it be temporal (i.e. days to available)?

* Good way to represent "saving a book for later" but without putting it on hold? I want to rember these
