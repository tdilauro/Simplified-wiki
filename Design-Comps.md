3. Profile


## Core Feedback
* Background blur
 * Jen has vetoed because design committee (she + COMM wouldn't approve)
 * "It's just not on brand"
 * "I don't have anything I can give you for mobile now."
* Circular profile photos
 * If we're using them, we should use them everywhere
* Colors
 * Eliminate red
  * Was in the original but Jen is using it only for donate and massive callouts

Differing aesthetic is warming on Jen because of the sharability of it and need for customizability form partner libraries.

* "First thing is contrast. As long as what's happening in the backgournd is not contrasted"
* Topscreen icons should be same size as NYPL Logo in menu on main screen
* 


* Profile page: 3 major sections don't exactly match
 * Each of the sections is visually different; inconsistent styles

* Jen's cool with the design direction now that it's generalizable

* Do we have a concept of a username for NYPL sign-in?
* Where are the books I've checked out?
 * Homescreen - would be another vertial row for Just Checked Out
* Show expected arrival time
* Should make a very clear statement when you've got to take action to check out an item
