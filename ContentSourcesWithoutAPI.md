Many content sources used by libraries cannot be integrated into the Library Simplified ecosystem because they don't have an API that meets our requirements.

## No API, no custom app

### Biblioboard
### Gale Virtual Reference
### Grey House
### Capstone
### ComicPlus
### Marshall Cavendish
### Salem Press

### BookFlix/Science Flix/TrueFlix

from Scholastic.

### IndieFlix Videos

IndieFlix is a partner with Recorded Books but they don't use the same API.

## No API, custom app

A service that provides a custom app must have some kind of API--that's how the app talks to the server. In a pinch we might be able to negotiate the circulation manager's access to this same API.

## hoopla

[hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/) offers several media formats: ebooks, movies, music etc. They stream content to the patron's device via a custom app.

Patrons choose a library that offers hoopla service, then verify their membership in that library by providing barcode and (optional) PIN. Presumably this is done through an ILS integration. Apart from this ILS integration, hoopla offers no integrations to a library.
