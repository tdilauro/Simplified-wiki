The Library Simplified project aims to streamline the experience of borrowing electronic books from a public library. We offer:

* A mobile e-reader (iOS and Android) that focuses on patron experience and accessibility.
* Seamless integration of collections from multiple vendors.
* Easy access to a wide variety of public domain and open-access books.

*Our goal is to make it as easy to borrow an electronic book from your local library as it is to buy one from an online store.*

This wiki is written by the Library Simplified developers and intended for use by technical staff at libraries. For details on how to get your library involved, see [[the Library Simplified website|http://www.librarysimplified.org/]].
