### Reading
#### Repositories from Readium Foundation
Readium SDK is an open source project developing a productized, high-performance, cross-platform rendering engine for EPUB 3 content, optimized for use in native applications (mobile/tablet and secondarily desktop systems). Simplistic test applications for Android, iOS, OS/X and Windows are part of the SDK, along with test frameworks. Readium SDK is extensible in various areas including DRM support. Readium SDK will be dual-licensed under both GPL and a commercial-friendly (non-copyleft) license. Note that the default license currently in the open source code on github is GPL.

A separate sub-project intends to in parallel develop an interoperable implementation of a lightweight content protection technology (DRM) that can be implemented into the modular framework of Readium SDK. This DRM will be available under a separate license, terms and conditions TBD.
